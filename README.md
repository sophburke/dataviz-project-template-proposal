# Data Visualization Project

## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project is the [HarvardX-MITx Person-Course Dataset AY2013](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/file.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/26147/OCLJIV&version=10.0) . It contains de-identified data from the first year of MITx and HarvardX courses on the edX platform.

## Prototypes

Iâ€™ve created a proof of concept visualization of this data. It's a bar chart and it shows viewing by course and engagement levels

## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

 * How do the viewing amounts vary according to course?
 * Is there any correlation between engagement levels and viewing amounts?
 * What viewing patterns do people from different countries have?
 * Is there a relationship between the number of viewing events and discussion forum postings?

## Sketches



## Open Questions

(I don't know how to map the viewing data onto the location data on top of a map.)
