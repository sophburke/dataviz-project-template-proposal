# Data Visualization Project

## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project is the [HarvardX-MITx Person-Course Dataset AY2013](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/file.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/26147/OCLJIV&version=10.0) . It contains de-identified data from the first year of MITx and HarvardX courses on the edX platform.

## Prototypes

Iâ€™ve created a proof of concept visualization of this data. It's a bar chart and it shows viewing by course and engagement levels

(please put a screenshot of one or more visualizations of this dataset you already made, for previous assignments)

## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

 * (insert your question or task here) How does the viewing amounts vary according to course
 * Is there any correlation between engagement levels and viewing amounts?
 * What viewing patterns do people from different countries have?
 * Is there a difference in the amount of views according to institution?

## Sketches

(insert one or more hand-drawn sketches of interactive visualizations that you imagine)
(describe each sketch - how is the data visualized, what are the interactions, and how do these relate to the questions/tasks)

## Open Questions

(I don't know how to map the viewing data onto the location data on top of a map.)
